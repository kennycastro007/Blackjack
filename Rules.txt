Dealer must always hit while under 17
If anyone goes over 21, they bust

Steps:
    1.) Shuffle deck
    2.) Prompt user for number of players
    3.) Initialize all players
    4.) Deal 2 cards to all players(including dealer)
        -When printing out all cards, Hide 1 of the dealer's card( "*hidden card*")
    5.) Have players place their bets
    6.) Dealer's turn:
        - if hand > 21 : end game, house loses, all players win 
            else : Dealer hits
    7.) Player's Turn(repeat for every player):
        -if hand == 21 : end turn, player has 21
            else : prompt player if he wants to hit or stay,
                    continue until player stays
        -if player gets an Ace, value is calculated as high, until the high busts, then low
    8.) Rotate across all players until all players have stayed

    9.) Determine whether or not players lost - in a tie neither player gets paid, all bets are returned
        Possible Outcomes:
            -Dealer Busts :             Player wins
            -Player Busts :             Dealer wins
            -Player has higher hand :   Player wins
            -Dealer has higher hand :   Dealer wins
            -Both players tie :         Tie
